Who am I? To get started, I am a _Rock Climber, Guitar player, Hydrogeologist, R Programmer (I like to think of myself as an aspiring data scientist), Woodworker, Cat owner_....

I am currently an Environmental Scientist (hydrogeologist) for the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. My job focuses on oversight and monitoring of the Department of Energy Superfund site in Oak Ridge. I work some of my time in the field, where I am project lead over two surface water sampling programs. I also help with field activities such as groundwater sampling, rad walkovers, and air sampling to name a few. I also spend much of my time reviewing documents and analyzing environmental data. Over the years, I have become rather fluent in the R programming language. I have used this skill to help TDEC by building R Shiny applications and by performing routine data analysis tasks. 

I was formerly a graduate student at The University of Tennessee, where I graduated in 2018. My research focused on hydraulic properties of fractured low-porosity rocks. In particular, I focused on measuring and modeling spontaneous imbibition of water into fractured granite, limestone, sandstone, and shale. My research provided me with several opportunities to work at the Neutron Imaging Facility at Oak Ridge National Lab and helped me to refine skills such as mathematical modeling and computer programming (R, Python). My research can be applied to applications such as deep disposal of waste, caprock integrity, and leak-off in hydraulic fracturing.

When I am not at work, you can find me out rock climbing with my wife on the great southern sandstone! Feel free to contact me by choosing one of the social icons at the bottom of this page.
